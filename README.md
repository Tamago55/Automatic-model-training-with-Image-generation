# Automatic model training with Image generation

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tamago55/Automatic-model-training-with-Image-generation/blob/master/Automatic-model-training-with-Image-generation.ipynb)

## Introduction
An automatic model training system using an image generation program.
Use generative AI to generate images with power outlets and label them with Grounding Dino. Train a YOLO model with the images and evaluate the model on your own, real world test set.

Below is a program that allows you to perform everything from image generation to model training and evaluation.

If everything is executed from the beginning, datasets and such are not necessary. However, inside the 'sample' in the same repository, there are generated images, labeled data, and pre-trained models included.

**Note**

Operation has been confirmed on Google Colab, so if you want to run it locally you will need to change the code by installing pip and folder.
